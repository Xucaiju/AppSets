An app store, inspired by Aurora Store. Who can help me with this task?

# Why?
This is my first application to learn Kotlin. When I saw that there was a way to access Google play store, I was very excited. So I developed AppSets. Thank you for all the open source libraries. Thank you for your efforts.
* **more features in the future**
